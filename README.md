# GpioExpanderLib
This library was created to use the MCP23017 16 port GPIO expander for hosting buttons and rotary encoder (dial) interfaces for your project.  The code is written to use MCP host interrupts and FreeRTOS queues to respond to button events.  This library is built with a dependency on the Adafruit-MCP23017-Arduino-Library.
