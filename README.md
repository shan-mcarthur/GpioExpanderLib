# GpioExpanderLib
This library was created to use the MCP23017 16 port GPIO expander for hosting a button interface for your project.  The code is written to use MCP host interrupts and FreeRTOS queues to respond to button click events.  This library is built with a dependency on the Adafruit-MCP23017-Arduino-Library.
