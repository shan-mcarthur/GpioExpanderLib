# Contributing
This is a new library and contributions on source is not open for the community at this time.  The plan is to open it for contributions once it is stable and I am prepared to support contributions properly.

In the meantimg, if you want to contribute to this project, consider:
- Reporting bugs and errors
- asking for enhancements including support for additional hardware and frameworks
- creating issues
- telling others about this library

## Guidelines
The following are some guidelines to observe when creating discussions / PRs:
#### Be friendly
It is important that we can all enjoy a safe space as we are all working on the same project and **it is okay for people to have different ideas**.
#### Use reasonable titles
Refrain from using overly long or capitalized titles as they are usually annoying and do little to encourage others to help :smile:.
